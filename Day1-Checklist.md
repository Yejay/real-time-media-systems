# Day 1 Tasks Checklist

## Setup & Environment (Tag 1)

### ✅ Completed
- [x] **Python Environment** - Created `whisper-env` virtual environment
- [x] **Project Structure** - Created all necessary files and folders
- [x] **Dependencies** - Created `requirements.txt` with minimal dependencies
- [x] **Core Scripts** - Created starter templates for all modules
- [x] **Setup Script** - Created automated setup script

### 📝 File Structure Created

```

## 🚀 Next Steps (Still TODO for Day 1)

### Installation & Testing
- [ ] **Run setup script:** `./setup.sh`
- [ ] **Test Whisper installation:** Verify base model downloads
- [ ] **Test ffmpeg:** Verify video/audio conversion works
- [ ] **Add test video:** Place a 2-3 minute video in `test_videos/`

### Quick Test Commands
```bash
# 1. Run setup
./setup.sh

# 2. Activate environment  
source whisper-env/bin/activate

# 3. Test individual components
python -c "import whisper; print('Whisper OK')"
python -c "import ffmpeg; print('ffmpeg-python OK')"

# 4. Add a test video and run
python main.py test_videos/your_video.mp4
```

## 🎯 Day 1 Success Criteria
By end of today you should have:
- [ ] Whisper installed and running
- [ ] A test video converted to audio
- [ ] Whisper able to transcribe the audio
- [ ] Basic pipeline working end-to-end

## ⚠️ Known Issues to Watch For
- **ffmpeg path issues:** Make sure it's in PATH
- **Whisper model download:** First run takes time to download models
- **Python environment:** Always activate virtual environment first
- **File permissions:** Make sure setup.sh is executable

## 📞 Team Coordination
- **Person 1 (Core Pipeline):** Focus on getting audio_extractor.py working
- **Person 2 (Integration):** Focus on main.py and CLI interface  
- **Person 3 (Testing):** Find good test videos and document installation issues

## 🔄 Tomorrow (Day 2) Preview
- Complete audio pipeline (video → audio → whisper)
- Test with multiple video formats
- Basic error handling
- Performance benchmarking
